# sentiment-analysis-nlp

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on collected comments about the Twitter app, using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to determine whether the comments are positive, negative, or neutral.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed in your environment:

- nltk (Natural Language Toolkit): For tokenization and part-of-speech tagging of the comments.
- textblob: For sentiment analysis.
- pandas: For data manipulation in tabular format.
- wordcloud: For generating word clouds based on text data.

Install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install nltk
```

```sh
pip install textblob
```

```sh
pip install pandas
```

```
pip isntall worddcloud
```
